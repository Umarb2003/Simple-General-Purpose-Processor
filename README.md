# Simple-General-Purpose-Processor
Developed and constructed an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using VHDL in Quartus, built on an FPGA board, integrating and creating components such as a Synchronous Reset D-Flip Flop Register, 4:16 Decoder, latches, and a Moore FSM to perform arithmetic and logical operations.
The project code was uploaded on the FPGA board and displayed the desired outputs on a seven segment display
